# Background
# ==========
# You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming
# social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know 
# what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is 
# up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information 
# and to define several procedures that operate on the network. 
#
# In a website, the data is stored in a database. In our case, however, all the 
# information comes in a big string of text. Each pair of sentences in the text 
# is formatted as follows: 
# 
# <username> is connected to <name1>, <name2>,...,<nameN>. 
# <username> likes to play <game1>,...,<gameN>.
# 
# Your friend records the information in that string based on user activity on 
# the website and gives it to you to manage. You can think of every pair of
# sentences as defining a gamer profile. For example:
# 
# John is connected to Bryant, Debra, Walter. 
# John likes to play The Movie: The Game, The Legend of Corgi, Dinosaur Diner.
#
# Consider the data structures that we have used in class - lists, dictionaries,
# and combinations of the two - (e.g. lists of dictionaries). Pick one which
# will allow you to manage the data above and implement the procedures below. 
# 
# You can assume that <username> is a unique identifier for a user. In other
# words, there is only one John in the network. Furthermore, connections are not
# symmetric - if John is connected with Alice, it does not mean that Alice is
# connected with John. 
#
# Project Description
# ====================
# Your task is to complete the procedures according to the specifications below
# as well as to implement a Make-Your-Own procedure (MYOP). You are encouraged 
# to define any additional helper procedures that can assist you in accomplishing 
# a task. You are encouraged to test your code by using print statements and the 
# Test Run button.

# Example string input. Use it to test your code.

# Arguments:
#   network: The network you created with create_data_structure.
